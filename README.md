# Random Password Generator

This project is a simple web application that generates a random password. The app allows users to generate secure passwords with various characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. It also includes a convenient copy-to-clipboard feature for easy password use.

## Features:
- **Password Generation:** Generates a random password of 12 characters in length by default.
- **Character Variety:** The password includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for enhanced security.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Users can easily copy the generated password by clicking the copy icon next to the password input field.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to work seamlessly across various screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.

## How it works:
1. **Generate Password:** When you click the "Generate a Password" button, the `createPassword()` function is triggered. This function generates a password by randomly selecting characters from different character sets (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).
2. **Display Password:** The generated password is displayed in an input field.
3. **Copy Functionality:** Clicking on the copy icon next to the input field copies the password to the clipboard using the `copyPassword()` function.
